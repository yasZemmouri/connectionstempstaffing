Microdata
Schema.org (often called schema) is a semantic vocabulary of tags (or microdata) that you can add to your HTML to improve the way search engines read and represent your page in SERPs.

Schema.org is the result of collaboration between Google, Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo! to help you provide the information their search engines need to understand your content and provide the best search results possible at this time.

Passive Events Listeners
Touch and wheel event listeners are useful for tracking user interactions and creating custom scrolling experiences, but they can also delay page scrolling. Currently, browsers can't know if an event listener will prevent scrolling, so they always wait for the listener to finish executing before scrolling the page. Passive event listeners solve this problem by letting you indicate that an event listener will never prevent scrolling.

This audit uses the following process to identify event listeners that may affect scrolling performance:

Collect all event listeners on the page.
Filter out non-touch and non-wheel listeners.
Filter out listeners that call preventDefault().
Filter out listeners that are from a different host than the page.
Why optimize it?
We recommend you to fix it to improve your webpage user experience
train to do media queries
train linear gradient
learn to use calc();
border-bottom effect

review querySelectorAll and use it to do phone or mail asterix
document.querySelectorAll('[property]'); // All with attribute named "property"
document.querySelectorAll('[property="value"]'); // All with "property" set to "value" exactly.
